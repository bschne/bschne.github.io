I'm not much of a gamer. 
I don't know why exactly, but I never really got into it,
or at least not compared to other people with my set of interests.

That being said, there have been some I've really enjoyed over the years.

## Daily Puzzles

I regularly play a range of daily puzzle games:

* Some
* New
* List

By the way, in case you are German/Swiss, you can find TMB, AAG.

## Serious Games

I basically play two sorts of games, puzzles and heavily narrativized ones that are maybe closer to something like an interactive movie than an FPS or MMORPG.

* Factorio
* The Witness
* Gorogoa
* Baba is You
* Zachtronics, e.g. ...? Someone in The New Yorker once described an arthouse movie as "perhaps more fun to think about than to sit through", and that kind of applies here. Link to that google talk.
* The Last of Us
* Uncharted 4
